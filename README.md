# Political Map(s) 2024

Simple `react` app to experiment with `D3` and `Plot`. Goal is to generate political maps for a friend using public data of Boston's precincts from the 2024 presidential election.

## To do

- add precinct layers, currently only showing wards
  - blocked by Boston.gov tech issues
- script to convert csv to JSON for better consumption
- Actually learn how to use D3/Plot

## Notes

Election data is gathered from this [Boston.gov source](https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/2024/11/Unofficial-Ward-and-Precinct-Results-State-Election-November-5-2024.pdf)
